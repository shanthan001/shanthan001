## Projects
- [Predictive Modeling for Type 2 Diabetes](https://github.com/shanthan001/T2-Diabetes-Mellitus-Detection): Developed a machine learning model which accurately predicts the mortality risks in elderly patients suffering from Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. The aim is to develop a single mortality prediction model for patients aged 65 years or older, comparing the performance of various machine learning algorithms to identify the most effective method for classifying patients into distinct risk categories, thereby facilitating more precise and effective treatment planning.
- [Exoplanet Study](https://github.com/shanthan001/Exoplanet-study): Conducted a data analysis on around 10,000 exoplanet candidates from NASAâ€™s Kepler mission, focusing on their classification, habitability, and the impact of observational and stellar parameters. Explored three main questions: the influence of observational parameters on classification, the habitability of Earth-size planets around different stars, and the correlations between disposition values and flag variables. Using models like GLMM (96.98% accuracy), Random Forest, and KNN, identified key predictors for planet classification including planetary radius and stellar effective temperature.
